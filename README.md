Please feel free to read and reference. You might find these less useful if you are not one of my classmates, but still feel free to read.
However, please do not use the notes for other purposes or distribute them anywhere else.

I do not hold copyright, since I am only a student typing everything Prof Garcia says down real-time. I also do not warrant the completeness, accuracy and correctness of this note collection.

Due to the notes being typed in LaTeX real-time in class, there might be a relatively large amount of errors and typos. I would appreciate if you submit an issue if you find one;
also, feel free to open a pull request if you feel like fixing anything or providing an alternative proof.
